                        Lexionlu have been working on a number of IFE projects since 2003, based on the platform of Panasonic Avionics Corporation. Our team has been able to provide IFE system solutions that go beyond customer expectations, Some examples to note are 3000i, eX2, and eX3. We have applied our operation flow designs that include conceptualization, developing prototype, to final design and user testing, to create new IFE systems. The application of new technology, such as touch solutions, are considered as well. The Karma Video Handset system sets a good example. This is the first handset control IFE system that has been made possible by a combination of operation flow design, user experience (UX), GUI, and capacitive touch solutions.

                                    eX3 is the most advanced widebody solution by Panasonic. It requires uncompromising industrial design, high-definition and
                                    3D display technologies, a portfolio of advanced capacitive touch handsets, and the latest advances in surround sound to
                                    create a home theater atmosphere. The eX3 interactive is based on an open platform architecture, which means that
                                    passengers can get an exciting entertainment experience and access to an unlimited number of applications accessible
                                    through capacitive touch screen monitors and handsets with familiar, intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) similar to
                                    today’s smartphones and tablets.

                                <p>
                                    The major challenges come from the switching procedures between the touch screen and the handset controller. The screen
                                    is in different size with the controller. We need to change the settings and operation flows accordingly to make these two
                                    devices switch smoothly.

                                    The Karma Touch-Screen Handset is the ultimate remote controller, which provides easy to use navigation for passengers and
                                    a dynamic GUI. This handset controller can work together with the touch screen or go separately. The latter gives the user an
                                    extra function in addition to the touch screen.

                                    The major challenge is how to keep the visual design style consistent with the touch screen, without making sacrifice of
                                    user-friendly interface. Our task is to make sure that the content is shown properly on the small touchable area.

                            Today's digital services involve much more than just creating a website and telling your customers. Modern digital services
                            are fully integrated with brand strategy and traditional marketing communications. They need to leverage inbound
                            marketing strategies like social media mining and webcasts. Everything from the choice of words when engaging the
                            blogger community down to the specific calls of action on a website must be carefully connected and designed to reflect
                            the brand being marketed.
